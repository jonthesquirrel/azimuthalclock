# Azimuthal Clock

Made by [Jonathan Herman](https://lasercar.github.io) using [D3.js](https://d3js.org).

This is an experimental design: the idea is to show all the world's time zones at once on a 24-hour clock using a [Polar Azimuthal Equidistant Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection).
